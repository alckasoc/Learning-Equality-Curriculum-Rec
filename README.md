##  üõë Requirements & Usage

[Insert more details about requirements (e.g. compute hardware, python  version, etc)]

If you haven't already, we recommend using a *virtual environment* before cloning. For more information on the package system we use, check out [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Also, this repository itself is not large, but we recommend having **at least 20 GB** available if you plan on testing code. The competition dataset is roughly **1 GB**. 

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/alckasoc/Learning-Equality-Curriculum-Rec
```

2. Install the requirements.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the competition data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learning-equality-curriculum-recommendations/data).

4. Move the downloaded zip file which should be called `learning-equality-curriculum-recommendations.zip` into the `input` folder.

5. Extract the zip file into `input`. Rename the newly created folder which should be `learning-equality-curriculum-recommendations` to `competition_data`.
